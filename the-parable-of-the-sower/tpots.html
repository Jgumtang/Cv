  <h1>What is the meaning of "The parable of the sower?"</h1>
  <p>The parable of the sower is a story about "The Kingdom of God."</p>
  <p><b>The man representing God and the seed representing his message.</b></p>
  <p>When the seeds where tossed into different places by a <i>sower</i> some seeds grew while the
    others just fell by the path and were eaten by the birds.</p>
  <p> <b>The birds who ate the seeds
      represent Satan </b></p>

  <h2>What does it mean to me?</h2>
  <p>As I was reading a few articles about the parables of the sower, so far I have thought of it the same way
    as its original meaning.
  <p> But to me, God is telling humans what he wants us to believe
    in him for what he plans to do other words he wants to give a message as to how we can reach out to him and for other reasons.</p>
  <p> Now applying to the
    birds or the crows that ate the seed, I imagine that the seeds were humans that failed in some way
    or has done something unforgivable.</p>
  <p> So they just ended up going in the wrong place and fell into the wrong hands.
    And as for the "wrong hands" I mean the birds who ate the seeds.
